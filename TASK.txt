1. Install minikube and deploy:
  1.1 Sonar
  1.2 Jenkins
  1.3 Petclinic application (https://github.com/maseyka/petclinic-be, https://github.com/maseyka/petclinic-fe)
    1.3.1 Backend should have 3 replicas
    1.3.2 Resources should be labeled with build number.
    1.3.3 Frontend should be accessible from host machine on port 30010
    1.3.4 Application should have dummy Service Account with Role and RoleBinding (or ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding).
  1.4 Docker registry (unsecured)
  1.5 CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins should have:
    1.5.1 Application build.
    1.5.2 Application deployment in cluster.
    1.5.3 In case of successful deployment, tag resulting image as stable and push it in Docker registry.

For inquisitive mind (non–mandatory):
1. Add access to application via ingress.
2. Provide and show horizontal scaling for backend in CI/CD with performance test step.
3. Configure artifactory and push binary artifact there.

Technical considerations:
1. It would be easier to fork petclinic in your private repository, since you can then use Git webhook for Jenkins.
2. Accessible within host does not require to be accessible via localhost:30010
3. You will need to trigger build somehow, which means you will need to add changes in codebase. No need to do complex changes. Goal is a commit, not a change in codebase.
4. Consider checking Minikube addons, since they can ease your task.
5. You are not restricted in terms of tools. Feel free to use anything, you deem fit, as long as you can provide proper explanation and It does the thing.
